Feature: Testing an Employee Management Service REST API's - CRUD Operations
   Users should be able to submit GET,POST,DELETE,PUT requests to a web service

Background: 
Given Following Employee information is available in store

  |  3 | Suraj  |  29 | DevOps Engineer-2 |  13     |  1     |

Scenario Outline: Get Employee information using Emp-id
